Here, we provide data and Jupyter Notebooks for hands-on practice related to our recent work, which can be found at **Physics-informed neural networks and beyond: enforcing physical constraints in quantum dissipative dynamics** [https://doi.org/10.1039/D4DD00153B](https://doi.org/10.1039/D4DD00153B). Training data  is available on Zenodo at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13446756](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13446756)
